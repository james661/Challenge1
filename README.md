# Challenge1
Repository for the First Homework Assignment
This goal of this challenge was to optimize a website for a marketing agency.
Semantic HTML elements were provided by the starter code.
The Starter code provided a logical structure of HTML elements, with the headers beginning with "h1" and ending with the "footer".
I added accessible alt attributes for images in the event that the images do not load.
Heading attributes are in sequential order, as provided in the starter code.
I added a consice, descriptive title to the title element.
I added comments to every section of the CSS file, to better illustrate the function of each element.
Git pushes were orchestrated for each step, with multiple descriptive commit messages.
Starter code and mockup website provided by Bootcamp instructors. I do not own and did not create the starter code.
